<h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>


<ol>
  <li> First Step 
</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Mix together the saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, white pepper, and lime powder in a small bowl, and set the spice mix aside.</li>
</ul> 
  <li> Second Step 
</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Melt the butter in a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the  
    garlic and  onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 
    about 5 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and brown them over medium-high heat until 
    lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in the tomato puree.</li>
</ul> 
  <li> Third Step 
</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Stir in the canned tomatoes with their juice, the grated carrots, whole cloves, 
    nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and the Kabsa spice mix. Cook for about 
    3 minutes; pour in the water, and add the chicken bouillon cube.</li>
</ul> 
<li> Fourth Step
</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and cover the pot. Simmer 
    until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
</ul> 
<li> Fifth Step 
</li>
  <ul>
  <li>    Gently stir in the rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, 
    about 25 minutes; add the raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. Cover and 
    cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until the rice grains are separate.</li>
</ul>
